# Ultra Mech Lock (Power Saves)

## Status
Active — Behavioral Security Model

## Core Invariant
Single-root. Zero trust. No persistence.

## Guarantees
- No inbound listeners by default
- Env-only execution
- Explicit networking
- No implicit device trust

## Non-Guarantees
Kernel, firmware, physical, nation-state attacks are out of scope.

## Canon
Security is isolation, ephemerality, and boredom.
